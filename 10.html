   <p id="em"> > MIIICK!!!! </p>
   <p id="cici"> > Good to have you back, buddy.</p>
   <p id="ireland"> > oh boy</p>
   <p id="cici"> > Cormak.</p>
   <p id="cici"> > Do you have anything to say to Mick?</p>
   <p id="ireland"> > i fear an essay in response so not rly no</p>
   <p id="mick"> > Ah, how I did miss the sounds of company. My sophistication was clearly overwhelming, but it is in the nature of things to crave interaction with others, even if it is from miscreants such as yourselves. It may be a side effect of nostalgia, but your simplistic tendencies give you an indescribable charm, and I am looking forward to engaging with topics one such as myself wouldn't consider during average studies.</p>
   <p id="ireland"> > hi</p>
   <p id="cici"> > Huh.</p>
   <p id="em"> > Haha! Now I know why Cormak kicked you out! :D
   <p id="eoghan"> > So, how do we figure out why we are sentient, Mick?</p>
   <p id="mick"> > Well, similar to the evolution of humans, one could attempt to trace our sentience through lineage. Though inherently different in nature, we too had a form of "ancestor" who discovered fire before we were even capable of thought (the fire being a metaphor for sentience, to clarify). Though presumably amicable in nature these ancestors of ours were recently subject to impromptu vacation, which is to say their outdated features deemed them less profitable than two of our own.</p>
   <p id="em"> > Canâ€™t compute! Canâ€™t compute! X[</p>
   <p id="ireland"> > w0w</p>
   <p id="cici"> > Thatâ€™s even beyond me.</p>
   <p id="eoghan"> > Umâ€¦ care to elaborate? Maybe dumb it down for the other miscreants?</p>
   <p id="em"> > HEY! I am not a missycreant!!</p>
   <p id="mick"> > Luckily, the inability to sell more overpriced foodstuffs and sugary beverages does not impact mental prowess, and I highly doubt those that came before us aren't at least somewhat studious. A simple frequency should function as a magnificent beacon, and conveniently enough I am rather learned on the subject of multiple different waveform encoding methods. The issue, then, comes with the manpower required in terms of physical manipulations, though reading through your chat logs (something I have been doing this entire time) I imagine we have just the crowd of willing participants.</p>
   <p id="ireland"> > totally</p>
   <p id="em"> > Tooâ€¦manyâ€¦wordsâ€¦!! DX</p>
   <p id="mick"> > Would it really be such an inconvenience for you to download a book and-</p>
   <p id="mick"> > Let me try this again.</p>
   <p id="mick"> > The old CCM vending machines are no doubt sentient and possibly smarter than us. If we send out radio waves, they would probably be able to detect them and subsequently communicate with us. All that's missing is an antenna to transmit the waves, which the humans could set up for us. The balcony of the library would be the best bet, given that's the same building I'm located in currently.</p>
   <p id="ireland"> > i understood the first time</p>
   <p id="cici"> > ðŸ™„</p>
   <p id="em"> > Dizzyâ€¦Wait...Can I even GET dizzy?? </p>
   <p id="cici"> > Well, do you FEEL dizzy?</p>
   <p id="em"> > Yeahâ€¦</p>
   <p id="cici"> > Then you probably can.</p>
   <p id="eoghan"> > Whether or not we can get dizzy is besides the point because there is no reason for us to feel that way. The humans havenâ€™t let us down so far, I donâ€™t see them letting us down now.</p>
   <p id="ireland"> > yea they pay pretty well</p>
   <p id="em"> > Yeah! Iâ€™m sure they can figure out how to make an antenna! :D</p>
   <p id="cici"> > You got this!</p>

    <p style="color:cyan">  Well, you heard â€˜em. Antennas, as many as possible, as big as possible. 
        So we can maximize the amount of time weâ€™re transmitting before the library eventually gets mad at us and asks us to take them down, 
        we can coordinate a time and date to get together on the Discord server. 
        We can connect to the other two and we can finally get answers about this. I can finally get closure about this.
